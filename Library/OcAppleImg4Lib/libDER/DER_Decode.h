 * OK, use DERParseSequenceContent().

 * These never return DR_EndOfSequence - if an *unexpected* end of sequence
 * occurs, return DR_IncompleteSeq.
 *
 * Results of the decoding of one item are placed in a DERItem whose address 
 * is the dest arg plus the offset value in the associated DERItemSpec. 
 *
 * Items which are optional (DER_DEC_OPTIONAL) and which are not found, 
 * leave their associated DERDecodedInfos unmodified.
 *
 * Processing of a sequence ends on detection of any error or after the
 * last DERItemSpec is processed. 
 *
 * The sizeToZero argument, if nonzero, indicates the number of bytes
 * starting at dest to zero before processing the sequence. This is 
 * generally desirable, particularly if there are any DER_DEC_OPTIONAL
 * items in the sequence; skipped optional items are detected by the 
 * caller via a NULL DERDecodedInfo.content.data; if this hasn't been
 * explicitly zeroed (generally, by passing a nonzero value of sizeToZero),
 * skipped items can't be detected.
